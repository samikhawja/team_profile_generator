<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Terminal Prompt GIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/uUh514IlnzSCDfbQyy/giphy.gif)

For this application, I had to finsh the provided files to create a README generator. The user will be prompted questions in their terminal and from there, a README markdown will be generated. Per usual, this tested my knowledge with node.js and made me do a bunch of research to deliver the best application to the user. Of course, this was a fun to make and look to implementing an html to the application!

The websites I used to help create the application are listed below in the <a href="#acknowledgements">acknowledgements</a>.

### Built With

I used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> to finish creating the application. The files were provided by the professor and I just had to finish the build.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started with this application, you need to open the file in VS Code or something similar. From then, open your terminal, either in VS Code or on your computer and navigate to the README generator file. From then, use the command:
```
cd Develop
```
then, the following
```
npm i
```
then, the following
```
node index.js
```
After that, go through the prompts and once the last question is completed, a README will generate in the Develop folder called, "README.md"


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Code Snippets

<img src="./assets/images/webpage.png" alt="Terminal with propmts">

Below is the function I used to generate a readme markdown file. The code snippets starts with the prompt from inquirer and the response from that will console.log the report and then create a markdown called "README.md". The next part is the 'generateMarkdown' where it is a template literal for creating the template for the README.
```
function init() {
    inquirer
    .prompt(questions)
    .then((response) => {
        console.log(response)
        writeToFile("README.md", generateMarkdown(response));
    });
}
```
